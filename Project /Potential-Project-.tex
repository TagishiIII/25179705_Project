African Reserve Bank's Inflation Targeting Framework}

% Set to FALSE if wanting to remove title (for submission)











\begin{abstract}
\small{
The stagflation experience of the 1970s and 1980s exposed significant
weaknesses in global financial systems, particularly in how monetary
economics is used to achieve macroeconomic objectives. The experience
played a pivotal role in central banks adopting the inflation-targeting
framework as the primary focus of their mandate. Since 2000, the South
African Reserve Bank has operated within a 3-6\% inflation target band.
Recently, the SARB has made clear its intention to move to a 3\% point
target, based on the view that lower inflation begets stronger economic
growth. Using the Global Macro dataset, this paper begins with a brief
assessment of the effectiveness of this framework, followed by an
empirical analysis of how this framework has influenced the behaviour of
short-term and long-term interest over time. The findings aim to give
valuable insight as to whether the SARB should proceed with this
proposed transition

\section{\texorpdfstring{Introduction
\label{Introduction}}{Introduction }}\label{introduction}

The SARB has been given the constitutional mandate to protect the value
of the local currency. To achieve this mandate, it formally adopted the
inflation targeting framework in February 2000, with the explicit and
overarching aim to keep inflation low and stable. The measure of
inflation targeted at the time was the rate of change of the overall
consumer price index, excluding the mortgage interest cost (CPIX)
(\citeproc{ref-ellyne2011}{Ellyne \& Veller, 2011}). This target changed
to headline CPI inflation in 2009, following the alteration of the
measurement of housing costs, which essentially collapsed CPIX and CPI
into a single measure (\citeproc{ref-kahn2008}{Kahn, 2008}).

Under this framework, the SARB aims to keep inflation between 3-6\%,
with a preference closer to the midpoint of this band. The success of
this framework has been subject to much debate. According to
(\citeproc{ref-stiglitz2008}{Stiglitz, 2008}), inflation targeting is
doomed to inevitably fail, at great cost to those countries that
maintain it. This paper examines the validity of this statement by
conducting an empirical analysis to evaluate the behaviour of short-term
and long-term interest rates in South Africa since 2000, which, to a
certain extent, serve as indicators of conditions and monetary policy
credibility. Finally, this study gives insight into whether the SARB's
pursuit of price stability over this period justifies the transition to
a 3\% point inflation target.

\section{\texorpdfstring{Literature Review
\label{Literature Review}}{Literature Review }}\label{literature-review}

Globally, inflation targeting was first adopted in the 1990s, countries
like New Zealand and Canada were amongst the first to implement this
framework following the experience of stagflation, where a significant
portion of central banks accepted higher inflation in the hope that it
would boost economic growth, largely relying on the theoretical
foundations of the Phillips curve. However, this resulted in high
inflation and stagnant growth, exposing the shortcomings of this model,
particularly the failure to account for expectations
(\citeproc{ref-ellyne2011}{Ellyne \& Veller, 2011}). This would be a
turning point in monetary policy. Many countries, South Africa being
amongst them, explored several other ways of conducting monetary policy,
such as managing the exchange rates, which proved to be inferior to
inflation targeting (\citeproc{ref-loewald2025}{Loewald, Steinbach \&
Rakgalakane, 2025}). The late 1990s and early 2000s posted strong growth
and more stable inflation rates, with evidence suggesting that countries
that targeted inflation enjoyed , on average, 4.8\% less inflation over
the 1990-2004 period (\citeproc{ref-IMF2006}{International Monetary
Fund, 2006}).

Locally, there has been mixed reviews on the success of this framework,
studies show that since 2000, the SARB has missed its inflation target
in several years, not only prompting criticism from parties such as
COSATU ( Congress of South African Trade Unions ) but raising doubts
around how successful the regime has been in managing price stability,
relative to the previous regime (\citeproc{ref-ellyne2011}{Ellyne \&
Veller, 2011}). Unfortunately, these doubts have economic consequences.
If the SARB cannot credibly commit to staying within the band, then that
increases the perceived economic risk of lending into the economy,
especially given the dire state of our government. While short-term
rates are closely tied to the central bank's policy rate (the repo
rate), long-term rates are largely driven by inflation expectations and
the corresponding risk premium associated with long-term investments.
Both fundamentally depend on the credibility of the SARB's commitment to
its inflation mandate.

\section{\texorpdfstring{Data
Description\label{Data Description}}{Data Description}}\label{data-description}

This study uses the Global Macro Dataset, an open-source and regularly
updated database that compiles macroeconomic data for 243 countries. The
dataset integrates data from reputable international organizations, such
as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The database
covers global macroeconomic trends from the early days of data
collection to projected estimates in 2030, with historical data compiled
by economic historians to ensure accuracy over time
(\citeproc{ref-muller2025}{MÃ¼ller, Xu, Lehbib \& Chen, 2025}).

This study makes use of the inflation-related data for South Africa from
2000-2024, to examine insightful trends over this period.

\subsection{Analysis}\label{analysis}

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{Potential-Project-_files/figure-latex/Figure1-1} 

}

\caption{ \label{Figure1}}\label{fig:Figure1}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{Figure1} provides support for some of the criticisms
directed at the SARB. The SARB was unable to keep inflation within the
inflation target band in 10 of the years since 2000. An outlier occurred
in 2008 where the inflation rate reached 10.06\%, it is key to note that
this is before the Global Financial Crisis that would ensue, thus this
performance cannot be attributed to a once in a lifetime event, instead
oil price shocks and domestic price increases played a major role
(\citeproc{ref-honohan2022}{Honohan \& Orphanides, 2022}) , indicating
that monetary policy failed to act aggressively enough to keep inflation
stable and within range.

While consulting with additional other sources such as
(\citeproc{ref-StatsSA2004}{Statistics South Africa, 2004}), I have
taken the -0.69\% inflation rate in 2004 with a grain of salt because it
does not fully align with the literature, however, the consensus is that
inflation in this period was low and quite possibly lower than the 3\%
bound, and yet the South African economy saw strong growth, fuelling
belief that a lower inflation rate is the key to growth.

The fact that the inflation rate reached 10.6\% in 2008 raised
significant concerns about the effectiveness of the inflation targeting
framework. Was it doomed to fail just as Stiglitz predicted? Since
economic agents base their investment decisions on their expectations of
the central bank's ability to achieve their commitment goal, the
credibility of the SARB is crucial. The next diagram uncovers how
interest rates have behaved following the 2008 peak, with the belief
that these interest rates represent agents' evolving perceptions of the
central bank's credibility.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{Potential-Project-_files/figure-latex/Figure2-1} 

}

\caption{ \label{Figure2}}\label{fig:Figure2}
\end{figure}

Following the inflation rate peak in 2008 as shown in \ref{Figure2} and
\ref{tab8} , long-term interest rates have consistently remained above
inflation and short-term interest rates. This suggests investors demand
higher returns for holding long-term investments, reflecting concerns
about the riskiness of investing in South Africa and doubts about the
SARB's commitment to maintaining price stability.

The short-term interest rate has reacted ambiguously over this period.
This is not surprising because short-term interest rates typically track
the central bank rate (repo rate). Unless there is a complete loss of
credibility of the central bank, this rate will remain closely linked to
the central bank rate, as shown in below.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{Potential-Project-_files/figure-latex/Figure3-1} 

}

\caption{\label{Figure3}}\label{fig:Figure3}
\end{figure}

Table \ref{Figure3} introduces the central bank rate to this paper,
commonly known as the repo rate in South Africa, which is the rate at
which the central bank lends to commercial banks. This is the primary
tool used by the SARB to influence short-term interest rates and
inflation. The repo rate is forward-looking, meaning that it is set
based on the central bank's expectation of future inflation. For
instance, should the SARB expect inflation to rise in the next year, it
may raise the repo rate now, even if current inflation is still within
the target. The figure shows that it is common practice for the central
bank to set the repo rate above inflation to maintain price stability.
However, during the 2021-2022 period, inflation exceeded the repo rate
\ref{tab9}. This deviation from normality can be largely attributed to
the COVID-19 pandemic, where economic activity had been limited since
2020, and the SARB kept the repo rate relatively fixed over this period
to help the economy recover.

\section{\texorpdfstring{Statistical
modelling\label{Statistical modelling}}{Statistical modelling}}\label{statistical-modelling}

To add rigour to the findings in Section \ref{Data Description} and to
capture the movements that may be lost in visual illustrations, this
section explores key econometric techniques to reinforce and validate
the findings.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rrrrr}
  \hline
 & Estimate & Std. Error & t value & Pr($>$$|$t$|$) \\ 
  \hline
(Intercept) & 3.8108 & 1.0249 & 3.72 & 0.0023 \\ 
  infl\_lag1 & 0.2599 & 0.1754 & 1.48 & 0.1605 \\ 
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Inflation Persistence in South Africa (2008-2024) \label{tab4}} 
\end{table}

An Autoregressive (AR(1)) inflation model was used to see if the
inflation spike in 2008 had lasting effects on subsequent inflation. The
estimated coefficient of 0.259 as seen in \ref{tab4} and for the lag
inflation term is statistically insignificant, illustrating there is no
inflation persistence in South Africa and that the shock of 2008 was
short-lived. Importantly, a lack of inflation persistence may reflect
anchored inflation expectations and a trust that the SARB will respond
swiftly to inflationary pressures, implying a degree of credibility in
its commitment.

Furthermore, other econometric techniques such as Vector Autoregressive
Modelling (VARs) are powerful tools to analyse the dynamic relationships
between multiple variables over time. This adds further robustness to
findings by tracking how shocks in inflation, long-term, and short-term
interest rates affect each other over time. The findings are shown in
\ref{tab34} and \ref{tab7}.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rrrrr}

   \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{VAR Equation for Short-Term Interest Rate \label{tab34}} 
\end{table}

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rrrrr}
  \hline
 & Estimate & Std. Error & t value & Pr($>$$|$t$|$) \\ 
  \hline
infl.l1 & -0.04 & 0.11 & -0.33 & 0.75 \\ 
  short\_rate.l1 & 0.11 & 0.17 & 0.66 & 0.52 \\ 
  long\_rate.l1 & 0.63 & 0.24 & 2.65 & 0.02 \\ 
  infl.l2 & 0.08 & 0.09 & 0.91 & 0.38 \\ 
  short\_rate.l2 & -0.36 & 0.18 & -1.96 & 0.07 \\ 
  long\_rate.l2 & 0.28 & 0.19 & 1.47 & 0.16 \\ 
  const & 2.33 & 1.22 & 1.92 & 0.07 \\ 
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{VAR Equation for Long-Term Interest Rate \label{tab7}} 
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab34} shows that neither inflation nor long-term interest
rates has a statistically significant direct effect on short-term
interest rates. In contrast, short-term interest rates are strongly
influenced by their first lag, as shown by the statistically significant
estimate of 1.16. This shows that the market has been stable over this
period and that inflation expectations are likely well-anchored. In
support of this, \ref{tab7} confirms that the inflation expectations
remain stable and anchored, with long-term interest rates being
influenced by their lag and the second lag of the short-term rate. This
reinforces the credibility of the SARB in maintaining monetary
stability, despite occasional deviations from the inflation target. The
presence of outliers in interest rate behaviour thus does not imply
institutional weaknesses in the SARB.
